# OuterMath
A space shooter game designed to practice basic math. Made with Unity3D and PlayMaker.

## Gameplay

The player controls a spaceship while mathematical expressions appear on the screen and, at the same time, meteors with different answers advance towards it. The ship has controls for moving sideways and shooting projectiles that destroy meteors. Only one of the meteors will have the correct answer and the objective is to destroy all incorrect alternatives. If the ship collides with a meteor or destroys the correct answer, the player loses.

The game has three difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard), among which the player will choose one before starting. The easy one has one-digit addition and subtraction, the medium one has two digits and the difficult one has three digits.

(The images show the game in Portuguese - because I am Brazilian and this was the first version - but the current builds in the repository are in English)


## Development

The game was developed in C# with the Unity 3D game engine (2020.3.24f1), PlayMaker and other free assets / models from the Unity Asset Store. All scripts were created through PlayMaker, with its powerful visual scripting tool. Executable files were built for Windows (.exe), MacOS (.app) and Android (.apk).

## Objective

The game is simple, intuitive and fun, and therefore easy to use as a teaching tool, both inside and outside the classroom. Thus, it can be a powerful tool in the development of the logical reasoning in children and teenagers, since the gamification of content has proven itself to be an efficient way to bring students closer to school subjects.
